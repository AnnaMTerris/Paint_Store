# Paint Store website
## Main purpose of the project is to learn advanced CSS styles, especially focusing on colors. Step-by-step instructions were provided by Codecademy to improve a vibrant, color-rich web page for a home paint business. The following color related changes were executed:
+ Exchanged some named colors with hexadecimal color values.
+ Added some semi-transparent overlays to the banner and footer using RGBA.
+ Filled in the first color column of the swatch samples using HSL colors.
### By utilising git and publishing the final project on Github, I practised version control through the inbuilt terminal in VS code.
#### Project uses HTML and CSS.
##### Original code was provided by Codecademy.
+ CSS reset file provided by http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
